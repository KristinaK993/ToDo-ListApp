# ToDo-ListApp

**Vision**
The vision of this project is to develop a simple, user-friendly, and efficient task management system that helps individuals organize, track, and complete their daily tasks effectively. By providing an intuitive interface and essential features such as task categorization, deadlines, and prioritization, the application aims to enhance productivity and time management.

***Users*** should be able to categorize tasks (e.g., Work, Personal, Study).
***Users*** should be able to view a list of tasks sorted by priority and deadline.

**Non-Functional Requirements**
***Performance:*** The system should support at least 500 tasks per user without performance issues.
***Security:*** User data should be encrypted and protected from unauthorized access.
***Usability:*** The interface should be intuitive and require minimal learning curve.
***Availability:*** The application should be accessible from both desktop and mobile devices.
***Scalability:*** The system should be designed in a way that allows new features to be added without major changes to the architecture.
